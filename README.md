# EV_Data_Analysis_and_Recommendation_System

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data using Python, aimed at uncovering insights and building a user-friendly recommendation tool. Key tasks include:

1. Filtering EVs based on budget and range criteria to support practical decision-making

2. Grouping data by manufacturer and calculating average battery capacities for benchmarking

3. Visualizing relationships between battery capacity and range, and identifying outliers in energy consumption

4. Conducting hypothesis testing to compare engine power between Tesla and Audi, revealing brand performance differences

5. Developing a Python-based EV recommendation system that suggests suitable models based on user inputs (budget, range, and battery)

This project combines data analysis, statistical testing, and applied machine learning to enhance EV selection strategies and market understanding.
