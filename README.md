# EV_Data_Analysis_and_Recommendation_System

This project involves analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to uncover insights and support consumer decision-making. Key components include:

1. Analyzing EV range, battery capacity, and performance metrics to identify trends and insights

2. Conducting hypothesis testing to compare brand performance and validate assumptions

3. Developing a Python-based recommendation system that suggests EV options based on user inputs such as budget, desired range, and battery capacity

The project combines data analysis and practical application to help users make informed EV purchase decisions.
